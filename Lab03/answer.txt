1. When should accessor methods be used?
Accessor methods controls access to its attribute by providing a single location to inspect and/or modify that attribute. Code can also be added to perform operations such as range checks. 
The user's inputs of modification is also controlled by the system to make sure they fit the convention of the system.
2.If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
No, because if we do this, we will duplicate the created constructor. And Javascript does not support defining multiple constructors.
